When running currency converter:

At the main screen hitting Enter will start the currency converter.

Typing 1 then hitting enter will print out all the currencies that the converter can use, and loop back to the main menu.

Type q then hitting enter will exit the program.

This program will take any amount, an origin country currency code (The country you would like to convert the amount FROM), and then the country currency code of the country you would like to convert that amount to.  It will then print out a statement tellin you how much was converted from which type to the other type.
